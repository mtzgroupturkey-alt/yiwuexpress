# Optimise SEO

- **IS:** crawlability, metadata, structured data, canonicals, redirects, status codes, hreflang, AI-crawler policy and extractable page structure, Core Web Vitals, programmatic SEO, security and privacy headers, and error-page behaviour, implemented in a Next.js App Router codebase.
- **IS NOT:** visual redesign, layout, or page-level UI quality (`ui-design` Direction, Build, and Audit modes), demand research, briefs, question maps, or Search Console monitoring (`seo-program`), tenant routing for `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` (`multi-tenant-architecture`), or writing the article (external `ghostwriter`).

Allowed surface: `metadata` and `generateMetadata`, JSON-LD, semantic HTML, internal links, alt text, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/feed.xml/route.ts`, `app/llms.txt/route.ts`, `proxy.ts`, `next.config.ts` redirects and headers, error pages, and performance work. Component styling and layout stay as they are; when a fix needs a layout change, name it as a handoff to `ui-design`.

Before writing code, read the matching guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from the app directory; in a monorepo the `next` package is not visible from the repo root). The bundled docs match the installed version; the notes in `references/nextjs-implementation.md` were checked against 16.3 and say where behaviour changed.

## Workflow

Copy and track this checklist:

```text
SEO progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Inventory routes and decide index intent per route
- [ ] Step 2: Fix crawl/index foundations (sitemap, robots, canonicals, redirects, status codes)
- [ ] Step 3: Implement metadata and structured data
- [ ] Step 4: Improve semantics, extractable answers, internal links, and Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Step 5: Validate with references/seo-checklist.md and report evidence
```

Step 1 is a table: route, index or noindex, canonical, reason. Every later step reads from it, and a route with no row gets no work.

## Must-have on every site

- `app/sitemap.ts` lists every indexable URL with `lastModified` derived from content; `app/robots.ts` names it
- One canonical per page, one host, one casing, one trailing-slash policy, set through `alternates.canonical` with `metadataBase` in the root layout. Next.js enforces the slash policy itself: by default it 308s `/about/` to `/about`, and `trailingSlash: true` inverts that (files with extensions and `.well-known/` paths are exempt either way)
- Preserve the property's existing ownership verification. Use `metadata.verification` only for a supplied token and the chosen verification method; DNS verification needs no duplicate meta tag
- Root layout `robots` lifts Google's default preview caps: `googleBot: { 'max-snippet': -1, 'max-image-preview': 'large', 'max-video-preview': -1 }`. Without them Google truncates the snippet and the image preview, and the snippet cap is what AI surfaces read against when deciding how much of a page they may quote
- `authors` and `creator` set explicitly in the root layout, so person-level attribution does not live only in footer HTML and JSON-LD
- Unique title and description per page; title and H1 lead with the non-brand primary keyword and agree in intent (a brand-led title on a category page competes only for navigational queries the site already wins)
- Every page opens with a short, plain-text answer to the question it exists to answer; the h2s are the questions people actually ask
- Open Graph and Twitter Card tags with a 1200x630 image
- JSON-LD: Organization and WebSite once in a root `@graph` with stable `@id`s, BreadcrumbList on inner pages, then Article, Product, ProfilePage, or LocalBusiness where the content type matches. Define an entity once and reference it by `@id`
- One h1, logical h2-h6, descriptive alt text, internal links between related pages
- Core Web Vitals in target at the p75 of CrUX field data: LCP 2.5 s, INP 200 ms, CLS 0.1 (INP replaced FID in March 2024; a guide still naming FID is stale)

## Redirects and indexing policy

Load `references/indexing-policy.md` when routes move, duplicates need consolidation, or page indexing policy changes. Verify behavior against the installed Next.js version and served responses.

## AI crawlers and answer engines

Google needs no special files: AI Overviews and AI Mode run on Googlebot and core ranking, and `nosnippet` or `max-snippet:0` is the only opt-out (it removes the normal snippet too). Everything else is a robots decision per crawler class: search and citation bots (`OAI-SearchBot`, `Claude-SearchBot`, `PerplexityBot`) put a site in answers; training bots (`GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `CCBot`) do not; `Google-Extended` and `Applebot-Extended` are usage tokens with no crawler behind them. `llms.txt` costs one route and earns almost nothing measurable. The full table, `robots.ts` rules, Content-Signal, and the Markdown-alternate patterns are in `references/answer-engines.md`.

## Programmatic SEO

For pages generated at scale, load `references/indexing-policy.md`. Require demand evidence and unique page value before indexing a new pattern.

## Audit triage order

1. Crawl and index: robots, sitemap, stray `noindex`, canonicals, redirect chains, soft 404s
2. Technical: HTTPS, Core Web Vitals field data, mobile and desktop parity, AI-crawler access through the CDN
3. On-page: title and H1 uniqueness and non-brand lead, extractable answer, internal links, thin pages
4. Orphans: indexable pages with no internal link or sitemap entry; give them a crawl path or `noindex` and drop them. A sitewide footer link is not a crawl path on a low-authority domain: Google discounts footer boilerplate, and a section linked only from the footer can sit at "URL is unknown to Google" for months while nav-linked pages beside it are crawled daily

Report in the same order: what blocks indexation first, then on-page and schema gaps, then the single next fix. Twenty equal-weight findings get none of them done. Report length follows what was found, not the section list. Treat third-party audit tools as leads, not findings: several flag Next.js output falsely (a missing `<meta name="title">` when `<title>` is present, "duplicate" `theme-color` tags that are light and dark variants, repeated `article:tag`), and at least one agent-skill auditor silently skips modules unless given an explicit module list and passes a `FAQPage` whose answers never render. Verify each lead against the served HTML before it goes in the report.

## Gotchas

- Under `cacheComponents: true` (the `scaffold-nextjs` default) the `dynamic`, `dynamicParams`, `revalidate`, and `fetchCache` segment configs are build errors: `export const revalidate` on `app/sitemap.ts`, `dynamic = 'force-static'` on a `robots.txt/route.ts` handler, `fetchCache` anywhere (`runtime`, `maxDuration`, `instant`, and `prefetch` remain valid). Move the content fetch into a separate `'use cache'` helper with `cacheLife('hours')` and `cacheTag`, called from the page or `GET` (the directive cannot sit on the `GET` export itself), and `revalidateTag(tag, 'max')` from the publish webhook. Revalidation does not purge a CDN in front of the app; purge it in the same webhook.
- `generateSitemaps()` writes `/product/sitemap/0.xml`, `/product/sitemap/1.xml`, and no index file. List each generated file in `robots.ts` (`sitemap` takes an array) or hand-write the index at `app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`; otherwise Google sees only the ones it stumbles on.
- `lastModified: new Date()` on every sitemap row marks the whole site as changed on every deploy; Google then ignores `lastmod` sitewide. `priority` and `changeFrequency` are ignored outright, so emitting them buys nothing and clutters the diff.
- No `Host:` line in `robots.txt`. Yandex dropped the directive in 2018 in favour of a 301 to the preferred host, which `next.config.ts` already serves, and auditors flag the leftover line as an unknown directive. Leave `host` out of the `robots.ts` return value.
- Next.js replaces object-valued metadata (`openGraph`, `twitter`, `robots`, `alternates`) wholesale when a child segment declares the key; it does not deep-merge. A page that adds `openGraph: { title }` loses the inherited `siteName`, `images`, and `locale`, and `images: undefined` counts as a declaration. When you add one of these blocks to a route, every field the parent supplied becomes yours to restate. Scalars (`title`, `description`, `authors`, `creator`) merge normally.
- `title.template` applies to `<title>` only. `og:title` resolves against `openGraph.title.template`, a separate mechanism, so stripping a hand-rolled suffix from a page title silently strips the product name from the share card. Set both templates in the layout, or neither. A bare string `title` in a nested layout also resets the parent template to null for that subtree; return `{ default, template }` instead.
- Never set `openGraph.url` in a root layout. It is not per-page, every route inherits it, and every share collapses onto the home URL. A child cannot fix it without declaring `openGraph` and losing the rest of the block. Absent beats wrong: consumers fall back to the URL they fetched, and `alternates.canonical` is already per-page.
- `middleware.ts` is deprecated in Next.js 16. New request-time logic (slug checks, CSP nonces, `Accept` negotiation) goes in `proxy.ts` with an exported `proxy` function; `npx @next/codemod@canary middleware-to-proxy .` moves an existing file. Proxy is Node.js only; `runtime` is not a valid export there.
- `next.config.ts` redirects match in array order and `:path*` swallows everything beneath it, so a specific source placed after a catch-all is dead code, and a bare `/old` must sit above `/old/:path*` or it lands on `/new/`. Vercel caps the list at 1,024 rules; past that, move the map into `proxy.ts`.
- Next owns the `Vary` header on App Router HTML responses and replaces it with its RSC list (`rsc, next-router-state-tree, ...`). A `Vary: Accept` set in `proxy.ts` on `NextResponse.next()`, or in `headers()`, never reaches the client. It survives only on a `Response` you construct yourself, so content-negotiated Markdown must be returned directly, not rewritten to.
- `notFound()` after a Suspense boundary or `loading.tsx` has flushed returns 200 with a `noindex` meta, not 404. Without Cache Components, call it before the first suspending `await`; with Cache Components the docs are explicit that every dynamic route streams a static shell first, so the existence check moves to `proxy.ts`. Analytics and uptime monitors otherwise see a healthy 200 for a missing page. The `noindex` meta on a real 404 is injected by Next.js automatically, including on `global-not-found`, so adding `robots` to the 404 page changes nothing.
- `redirect()` and `permanentRedirect()` called once streaming has started emit a client-side `<meta>` redirect on a 200, not a 307 or 308. A moved slug handled inside a page under Cache Components ships as 200 plus meta refresh; permanent moves belong in `next.config.ts` or Proxy.
- HTML-limited bots (`Twitterbot`, `Bingbot`, `facebookexternalhit`, and Next's default list) skip the prerendered shell and get the whole page rendered dynamically at request time. Anything the shell reads only at build time (an `fs` read that is absent in the deployed function, a build-time env var) can fail for a crawler while the page loads for a person. `curl -A Twitterbot` exercises that path; run it on every route that touches the filesystem.
- `curl -s <url> | rg canonical` on a page with dynamic `generateMetadata` may find the tag in `<body>`, because Next.js streams metadata for non-bot user agents. That is valid for Googlebot. To see the blocking `<head>` form, pass `-A Twitterbot`.
- A nonce CSP forces every page dynamic: no static generation, no ISR, no prerendered shell, and Partial Prerendering is incompatible with it outright. Adding it to fix a scanner warning costs the site its cache; use the static `next.config.ts` header unless compliance forbids `'unsafe-inline'`.
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` on a catch-all `headers()` rule blocks the OG image for every social scraper, which fetches it cross-origin. Add a later rule for `/opengraph-image` setting `cross-origin`; per header key, the last matching rule wins.
- `app/opengraph-image.tsx` serves at `/opengraph-image`, not `/opengraph-image.png`. Hardcoding the extension in `openGraph.images` produces a dead card whose markup looks right. Under a `basePath`, Next prefixes a static `app/opengraph-image.png` with the base path and a generated `.tsx` route not at all, so a `metadataBase` that includes the base path doubles the prefix on the PNG form (`/glide/glide/opengraph-image.png`) and is correct on the generated form. Read the emitted `og:image` out of `next build` output, never `next dev`, which rewrites `metadataBase` to the dev origin.
- The documented home for `.well-known` discovery files is a route handler at `app/.well-known/<name>/route.ts`; `trailingSlash` also exempts everything under `.well-known/`. What does not work: serving them from `public/.well-known/` (dotfiles are dropped by the static pipeline) or reaching a single-segment dotted path such as `/.well-known/mcp.json` through a `next.config.ts` rewrite, which one 16.x deployment found answered with a prerendered 404 while the two-segment `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` rewrote fine. If a rewrite is unavoidable, do it in `proxy.ts` with the literal path in the matcher.
- Proxy matchers are anchored at both ends. A bare `/about` entry matches `/about` and nothing beneath it, and `/writing/:slug` matches one segment; the docs' matcher page says `/about` also matches `/about/team`, but the regex `getMiddlewareMatchers` compiles in 16.3.0 ends in `[\/#\?]?$`. List every negotiable path, or use `:path*`.
- Route handlers that are statically prerendered (`sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `llms.txt`) run at build time and again only when their cache revalidates, so an analytics capture inside one fires once per deploy. Per-request capture belongs in `proxy.ts` behind `event.waitUntil()` or `after()`. And a `try/catch` in a `GET` handler catches the prerender bail-out too; set `experimental.hideLogsAfterAbort: true` or every cached handler logs a stack trace during the build.
- `next/image` deprecated `priority` in 16 in favour of `preload`; for the LCP hero the docs prefer `loading="eager"` or `fetchPriority="high"` and reserve `preload` for the one image that must start before the HTML finishes parsing. Keep the LCP element outside or above every `<Suspense>` boundary, size skeletons to the content they replace, and send field data through `useReportWebVitals` from a tiny client component.
- Blocking `GPTBot` to stay out of ChatGPT answers does the opposite of the intent: `GPTBot` is training only, `OAI-SearchBot` is what puts a page in ChatGPT search, and `ChatGPT-User` fetches live when a person asks. Same shape for `ClaudeBot` versus `Claude-SearchBot` and `Claude-User`.
- Disallowing `Google-Extended` does not remove a page from AI Overviews; it only withdraws Gemini training and grounding. The AI Overviews opt-out is `nosnippet` or `max-snippet:0`, and it removes the ordinary snippet too.
- Cloudflare blocks known AI crawlers by default on zones created since July 2025 and prepends its own `Content-Signal` block to `robots.txt`. Check `curl -A OAI-SearchBot` against the live host before editing `robots.ts`; the code can be right and the site still uncitable.
- Vercel omits `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` from a custom domain on a non-production branch. `staging.example.com` indexes unless the `headers()` rule adds it.
- `noindex` plus a canonical to production on a duplicate is self-defeating: Google does not consolidate from a page it is told not to index. Canonical alone for duplicates; `noindex` alone for previews.
- A Lighthouse pass is a lab run on one device. Google assesses the p75 of CrUX field data, and a green Lighthouse score with a failing field assessment is routine. Report both, and name the metric that fails in the field.
- Never invent Search Console coverage counts, crawl stats, or traffic numbers in an audit; the fix lands on the wrong page. Write "no data" and name the missing access.
- Schema the page has not earned (`FAQPage` without visible questions, `Person` with no named author, `Review` with no review) is treated as spam. `FAQPage` lost its rich result on 7 May 2026, so the upside that used to offset that risk is gone. Every claim in JSON-LD must be verifiable in the served DOM: a FAQ whose answers never render, or a `BreadcrumbList` naming a crumb the visible trail does not show, is a structured-data policy violation, and answer engines quote the DOM, not the script. Check built HTML, not the source; a substring test for `"@type":"FAQPage"` passes the broken page.
- `JSON.stringify` does not escape `<`. Replace it with the `\u003c` escape in the JSON-LD serialiser every time, as the Next.js JSON-LD guide does; deciding case by case whether a field could carry HTML is how a later content change turns into script injection.
- Google's Article doc has no required fields and `publisher` is optional. When you include it, make it the Organization with a `logo`; a `Person` publisher fails the Rich Results Test warning check.
- Indexable content moved behind `"use client"` plus a fetch in `useEffect` is invisible to every crawler that does not run JavaScript, which is all the AI agents and the initial Googlebot pass. Server Components already render on the server; this is a regression you introduce.
- Non-reciprocal `hreflang` (one alternate missing from one page) drops the whole set. A canonical pointing across languages drops the localised page.
- `Strict-Transport-Security` with `preload` before every subdomain is HTTPS is effectively irreversible: removal takes months to reach browsers. Ramp `max-age` through 300, 604800, and 2592000 first.
- Google Ads or GA4 tags on EEA/UK traffic without `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` consent signals (Consent Mode v2, mandatory since March 2024) silently degrade conversion measurement; the banner can be perfect and the data still wrong.
- A maintenance window served as 200 or 404 gets the site deindexed over a long outage. Return 503 plus `Retry-After`.
