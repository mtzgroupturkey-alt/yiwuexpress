# Verification Gate

Checks that must pass before any commit the monitor pushes, plus the stray-artifact sweep before commit. Pushing red work or stray files wastes a whole poll cycle.

## When the gate runs

Run after applying a fix (Phase 3 CI fix, or a triage review-comment fix) and **before** that fix's commit/push. On failure: fix, re-run, do not push until green. Local verification; CI is the backstop, not the first line of defence.

## Detect available checks

Read the project's task runner; run only checks that exist. Do not assume fixed script names.

```bash
# npm/yarn/pnpm projects: read the scripts block
jq -r '.scripts | keys[]' package.json 2>/dev/null
```

Map common names (a project may use any subset):

| Check       | Common script names                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| lint        | `lint`, `lint:fix`, `eslint`, `oxlint`       |
| type-check  | `typecheck`, `type-check`, `tsc`, `check`    |
| test        | `test`, `test:unit`, `vitest`, `jest`        |
| dead code   | `knip`                                       |

Non-npm runners: `turbo run <task>`, `nx run <task>`, `make <target>`. If no checks exist, say so and skip the gate rather than inventing commands.

## Run order and scope

Run in increasing cost order; stop and fix on the first failure.

1. **type-check**: fastest signal on a fix. Scope to changed files where the tooling supports it, else run the project script.
2. **lint**: scope to changed files (`eslint <files>`, `oxlint <files>`) when possible.
3. **test**: run the project test script. Scope to affected tests where an affected mode exists, else run the full suite. Use the quiet reporter (`--reporter=dot`, `--silent`) or capture a log and inspect its tail while preserving the original exit status: the full output is re-sent on every later turn of the monitor.
4. **knip**: run last (project-wide by design). Handling is the `knip` item of the failure classification in `ci-platforms.md`.

**All present checks must pass before committing.** A type-check failure may be a stale-dependency issue, not a code bug; check the stale-dependency branch in `ci-platforms.md` first.

## Stray-artifact sweep

Pre-commit hooks and build/check steps can dirty the working tree with files **not** part of the intended fix (canonical case: a root-level `schema.gql` or similar generated output emitted by a hook). Committing these pollutes the PR and trips reviewers.

After checks and hooks, inspect the tree:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

For each untracked or modified file, decide:

- **Intended**: part of the fix, or a tracked generated file the change is supposed to update. Keep it.
- **Stray**: generated output or formatter churn introduced by this run. Leave unrelated work unstaged. Remove only newly generated files whose ownership is established, and reverse only this run's hunks in pre-existing files. Do not restore whole files against HEAD.

Stage only the fix's files: `git add <paths>`, never `git add -A`, so stray files are never committed. The skill's own state and plan files under `.claude/pr-babysitter/` are always stray: they never go in the PR.

## Pre-commit hooks that emit artifacts

A hook can dirty the tree *during* the commit, after your sweep. Re-check after committing:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Inspect the commit diff separately from the working tree. Uncommitted artifacts do not require an amend. If the monitor's own unpushed commit accidentally included an artifact, stage only its correction and amend that commit. Preserve any pre-existing index entries; never clear the whole index as cleanup.

## Gate failure handling

- **Lint/type/test failure on the fix**: read the error, fix, re-run the gate. Do not push.
- **Failure unrelated to the fix** (flaky test, pre-existing type error elsewhere): note it; don't expand scope to fix unrelated breakage in a comment-triage commit. If it blocks the gate, surface it to the user instead of pushing past it.
- **Gate can't run** (no scripts, missing deps): say so in the notification; rely on CI and flag that local verification was unavailable.
