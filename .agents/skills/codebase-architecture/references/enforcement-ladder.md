# Enforcement Ladder

How to introduce a check into a codebase that already violates it. Load when adding any guardrail to an existing repo.

## The ladder

Take the first rung that holds.

1. **Fix the violations and block.** Correct whenever the count is small enough to fix in the same change. The cleanest outcome and more often reachable than it looks: run the tool before assuming otherwise.
2. **Scope with the tool's own config.** Every tool in this category ships one: `knip.json` `ignore` and `ignoreDependencies`, jscpd `ignore` globs, dependency-cruiser `pathNot`. The exclusion sits next to the rule, so anyone reading the config sees what is exempt.

   **Not the linter's `ignorePatterns`** (ESLint and Oxlint both have one). It removes those files from *every* rule, not the one you are adding, so trading 400 long files for 400 unlinted files leaves the repo worse while looking like you followed the ladder. Rung 2 holds for the linter only when the violations sit in directories that should be unlinted anyway (generated output, vendored code); carve those out first and they come off the count before you pick a rung for the rest.
3. **Allowlist or downgrade in the linter.** An `overrides` entry (Oxlint's `.oxlintrc.json`, or an ESLint flat-config object scoped with `files`) naming the current offenders, or start the rule at `warn` and promote to `error` once burned down. Use this when the violations are a known finite list you intend to shrink. Prefer `error` plus an allowlist over a blanket `warn`: `warn` fails to block the next new violation, which is the whole point of adding the rule.

   List explicit paths, never globs, so the exemption cannot silently cover a file written tomorrow, and so growing it shows up as added lines in a diff a reviewer reads. That review is the only thing holding the list down. An allowlist has the same pull as the baseline file below (under deadline, the cheapest green is appending your path), and it does not even fail when it grows; what it has instead is that every addition is visible, attributable, and in the same file as the rule it defeats.
4. **Report-only, non-blocking CI.** The rule runs and prints, nothing fails. Lowest value, but it beats not running: the number is visible and the wiring is done for the day someone burns the list down.

Whichever rung you pick, **write down which and why** in the config file or the CI step itself. The next person needs to know whether they are looking at a deliberate exemption or an accident.

## Never hand-roll a baseline

Do not write a custom guard script plus a committed baseline file (`*-ratchet.mjs` and `*.baseline.json`) that records the current violation count, fails when it grows, and rewrites itself downward when it shrinks.

It is an appealing design and it does not survive contact. It was built and deleted for two reasons:

- **Every tool in the category already ships the mechanism.** Rungs 2 and 3 are native features of knip, the linter, dependency-cruiser, and jscpd. The custom layer reimplements them and adds a file that must be regenerated, reviewed, and merged.
- **The baseline becomes the thing people edit.** Under deadline the cheapest green is a bigger number, and a baseline that only shrinks by convention does not only shrink.

The exception is narrow: a genuinely bespoke invariant no tool expresses (a naming rule derived from file paths, a ban on a specific cast shape, registry completeness). Write that as a check, and even then use rung 1 or 3 for the existing violations rather than a count file. Structural specs that walk the filesystem cover most of this ground and ride the existing test command.

## Ship it green

Land the rule and the fix for its existing violations in the same change.

A rule that ships red teaches everyone, agent and human, that this particular check is noise to be worked around. That lesson generalises to the next check you add. The ladder exists precisely so you never have to choose between shipping red and not shipping.

## Prove it bites

The completion criterion for installing any guardrail, and the step most often skipped because the config "obviously" works:

1. Run the check. It must **pass**.
2. Introduce a violation on purpose (a deep import, a duplicated block, an unused export, a misnamed directory). It must **fail**, and the message must name the fix.
3. Revert. It must **pass** again.

A check nobody has watched fail is not known to work. The common failure is silent: a glob that matches nothing, a path alias the tool cannot resolve, a rule registered under a config section the runner never reads. All three produce a green run that proves nothing.

## Self-explaining failures

Every violation message states why the invariant exists and how to fix it, not just where it fired:

```
src/modules/billing/lib/invoice.ts is imported from src/modules/orders/checkout.ts.
Modules are reachable only through their index.ts, so internals can be
refactored without breaking other modules. Import from ~modules/billing instead.
```

An agent that gets this self-corrects on the spot. An agent that gets `no-restricted-imports` and a path guesses, or asks, or reverts something unrelated. Boundary-lint messages should also name the rule and link the convention doc, so the failure teaches the convention it enforces.

Some rules cannot carry a custom message: `max-lines` in both Oxlint and ESLint emits a fixed string with no why and no fix, and takes no `message` option. Where that is the case, put the explanation in a comment above the rule in the config, which is where anyone debugging the failure looks next, and do not let the gap talk you out of the rule.

## Graduated enforcement

Two variants of the same check, wired at different strictness:

- **Pre-commit:** fast and warn-only where the check is slow or noisy. Fast signal without blocking a work-in-progress commit. When a hook does fail an agent's commit, it self-corrects immediately; that is the cheapest QA round available.
- **CI:** blocking. This is the merge gate, and an invariant that is not gated here decays silently.

Wire both, always. Hooks are not guaranteed installed on a fresh clone or in a worktree, which is exactly where agents run; CI alone gives feedback long after the agent's edit loop has moved on.
